***Javascript Documentation***




**Types of Data in Java Script.**
- String 
- Number
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null
- bigInt
- Symbol
*There are a total of 7 data types in JavaScript*


**Variables** : A name for a particular place or value to call in the program. This
- *Declaring a variable* : **let variablename="string"** 
  - let is the keyword to declare a variable
  - variablename is the name of the variable
  - After = sign there exists the value fo the Variable


***Mental model for Variables in Javascript***
- A bucket has the data and the Variable Name points towards that data.
- This is the reason why A JS variable can store any kind of data without any extra hassle.
- <Variable> -> "zeeshan" (Variable name points to the value of the variable);

**File name for the below Concepts **: Define.js

***Conditions for Variable Names***
- Cannot start with a number
- Cannot have any special characters
- We can use $ and _ for variable names
- No spaces between variables names

***How to Write Multiple word variablename***
- let firstname="Piyush"; (Normal)
- let firstName="Piyush"; (Camel Case) (Mostly used in Javascript)
- let first_name="Piyush"; (Snake Case)
- let first-name="Piyush"; (Kebab Case) {not used in javascript but used in CSS instead}

***How to define and print a variable name***
- Let variable lets us to define a variable with it's own name and value.
- Console.log(""): Helps us to print the variable in the console.
- String can be defined in the following format:
  - ' ' : Single Quotes ; // Gets string variable doesn't matter if you are giving a single char or Multiple char.
  - " " : Double Quotes ;
  - `` : Back ticks ;
- Adding 2 string:
  - When 2 strings are added then a new string is generated with the new value and the new variable is pointed towards the new string.

**We can perform most of the operations in Javascript in same way as of CPP**
Precendence followed is :
- Parenthesis
- Exponent
- Multiplication / Division
- Addition / Substraction
**For the functions in same order of precedence. The one that comes first from left to right will be resolved first.**

***Conditional and their signs***
- === : Equality Check with type check
- !== : Not Equal values or types
- ==  : Equality check for just values and not Types
- !=  : Equality check Not Equal values
- ">"=  : Greater than or Equal to values
- <=  : Less than or Equal to values
- ">"   : Greater than
- "<"   : Less than
*We cannot **Redeclare** a Variable in JavaScript but we can **Reassign** a value to the variable.*
